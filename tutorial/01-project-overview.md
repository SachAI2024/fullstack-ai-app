# Building a Full Stack Application with React, GraphQL, and AI Integration

## Project Overview

This tutorial will guide you through building a complete full stack application that uses React for the frontend, GraphQL for the API layer, and integrates with both OpenAI and HuggingFace AI services. The application features a toggle mechanism to switch between AI providers and implements a sophisticated data fetching mechanism with fallback to native system modules.

### What You'll Build

By following this tutorial, you'll create:

1. A React frontend with Apollo Client for GraphQL integration
2. A GraphQL server with Apollo Server and Express
3. A data fetching mechanism with fallback to native modules
4. Integration with OpenAI and HuggingFace APIs
5. A toggle functionality to switch between AI providers

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript
- Familiarity with React
- Understanding of GraphQL concepts
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React 18
  - TypeScript
  - Apollo Client
  - Styled Components

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Apollo Server
  - GraphQL

- **AI Integration**:
  - OpenAI API
  - HuggingFace API
